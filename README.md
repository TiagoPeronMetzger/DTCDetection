# DTCDetection
This program was made to colect the diagnostic trouble codes from a vehicle and save them in a csv file and their respective screen shots. The colected DTC would be used to create a table with all the vehicle DTCs so a scanner could use them

The scanner that was used  to collet the codes was the CONSULT-III, used in Nissan vehicles,
it was also necessary to use the software CANOE to emulate the CAN messages.

the efficiency of this project was not very good, there were a lot of characters that the tesseract
couldn't read very well, but since we had the screenshots from when the code was detected, we could
get them all.
